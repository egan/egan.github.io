## Me
I am a mechatronics engineer with interests in precision machine design and control.
While my degree is in mechanical engineering, I am also a hobbyist programmer with interests in scientific computation and text-based interaction.
I also have a minor degree in linguistics, which is my primary interest in the liberal arts.

A long-time lurker on [Hacker News](new.ycombinator.com), I have always enjoyed the insightful technical blogs common in the software engineering community.
However, as a student and continuing learner, I have been disappointed by the relative dearth of similar technical blogs for mechanical engineering theory and practice.
I seek to fill part of this niche with content on my curriculum and industry specializations as well as providing a mechanical engineer's perspective on modern programming and computing.
My hope is that this website may prove useful for students of engineering and the otherwise curious.

## Website
This site is hosted for free with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
It uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a **static** site generator written in Ruby.
I used the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme of the [Poole](http://getpoole.com) template to get started.

The name of the site, skezu'e (pronounced /skezuhe/) means "engineering" in [Lojban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban), a syntactically unambiguous constructed human language I have studied.
The word is a [lujvo](https://mw.lojban.org/papri/lujvo), a semantically conventionalized [tanru](https://mw.lojban.org/papri/tanru) (compound) of the [brivla](https://mw.lojban.org/papri/brivla) (predicates) [saske](http://vlasisku.lojban.org/vlasisku/saske) and [zukte](http://vlasisku.lojban.org/vlasisku/zukte).
Okay, enough [nerd-sniping](https://xkcd.com/356/).

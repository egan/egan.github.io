title: Nothing to Write? Oh, and neomutt.
tags: [misc]

So my last post was about how I might start writing more frequently for this site.
That was only 4 months ago....

I promised to write a post about neomutt if I got it working.
It turns out it was extremely easy to install and configure, and I did not feel as though there was anything interesting to contribute.
Well anyway, I recommend it for people who want an old-fashioned email client with modern features.

I have thought a bit about why I can't seem to generate any content here.
When I was in college I thought I would be brimming with ideas about what to write about.
At the time I was too busy.
Now I have the time, but the ideas are harder to come by.

I encounter plenty of interesting engineering challenges in my job, but I haven't felt that it was okay to write about them on a public forum.
And most of what I work on is very collaborative, so I feel a little uncomfortable writing about the solutions when it was the work of my colleagues that facilitated them.
A lot of engineering blogs I read appear to get around these problems by constructing an example just for the post.
They do a great job at this, but I worry that if I were to try that, the result would be overly terse or contrived.

What I know I could do, would be to write technological rants.
But that wouldn't be what I started this website for, and wouldn't be very valuable either.
So I will wait for inspiration to write something useful and interesting about my areas of expertise.
